## Where to open issues?

**Summary**:

* **Discussions**: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/project/discussions – the default place for anyone out there to open an issue. It means *one* place for people to do that. Discussions is a welcoming place where people can open a first issue, have a look around, etc. If those issues are substantive, they may move elsewhere (e.g. I did that with a spec issue recently)... But it's a good landing spot.
  * Also the catch-all for general questions, suggestions, ideas, support requests, etc.
* **Project**: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/project/issues – the default place for core team to organize and plan work, schedule sprints, etc. **NOT** for general discussion, ideas, support, etc.
* **Specs**: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs/issues
