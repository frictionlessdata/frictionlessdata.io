## Where to open issues?

**Summary**:

- **Discussions**: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/project/discussions – the default place for anyone out there to open an issue. It means _one_ place for people to do that. Discussions is a welcoming place where people can open a first issue, have a look around, etc. If those issues are substantive, they may move elsewhere (e.g. I did that with a spec issue recently)... But it's a good landing spot.
  - Also the catch-all for general questions, suggestions, ideas, support requests, etc.
- **Project**: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/project/issues – the default place for core team to organize and plan work, schedule sprints, etc. **NOT** for general discussion, ideas, support, etc.
- **Data Package**: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/issues
