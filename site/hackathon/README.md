title: Frictionless Hackathon
---

# Join the Frictionless Data community for a two-day virtual Hackathon on 7-8 October!

> Registration is now open using this form: [https://forms.gle/ZhrVfSBrNy2UPRZc9](https://forms.gle/ZhrVfSBrNy2UPRZc9)

> See the Participation Guide at the bottom for more info!

## What’s a hackathon? 
You’ll work within a group of other Frictionless users to create new project prototypes based on existing Frictionless open source code. For example, use the new [Livemark](https://livemark.frictionlessdata.io/) tool to create websites that display data-driven storytelling, or use Frictionless React [Components](https://components.frictionlessdata.io/) to add data validation to your application. 

## Who should participate in this hackathon? 
We’re looking for contributions of all sizes and skill levels! Some skills that you would bring include: coding in Python (other languages supported too!), writing documentation, project management, having ideas, design skills, and general enthusiasm! You’ll be in a team, so you can learn from each other and help each other. You don’t have to be familiar with Frictionless yet - you can learn that during the event.

## Why should I participate? 
First of all, it will be fun! You’ll meet other Frictionless users and learn something new. This is also an opportunity where you’ll have the uninterrupted support of the Frictionless core team to help you realize your prototype. Also, there will be prizes (details to be announced later).

## When will the hackathon occur? 
The hackathon will be virtual and occur on 7-8 October. The event will start at 9am CEST on 7 October, and will end at 6pm CEST on 8 October. This will allow people from around the world to participate during a time that works for them. We will be using Github and Zoom to coordinate and work virtually. Teams will be able to form before the event occurs so you can start coordinating early and hit the ground running.

## Sign me up!
Use [this form](https://forms.gle/ZhrVfSBrNy2UPRZc9) to register. The event will be free, and we will also have some scholarships for attendees that would otherwise be unable to attend. Apply for a $300 scholarship using this [scholarship form](https://forms.gle/jwxVYjDYs31t1YmKA
).

## What projects will be at the Hackathon?
Projects will range from a GeoJSON Plugin for frictionless-py, to  Python code to work with Datapackages in CKAN, to creating a static site to list all the Frictionless datasets on GitHub, to creating new tutorials for Frictionless code.
All of the projects will be added to the event dashboard at [https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/event/1#top](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/event/1#top), powered by [DribDat](https://dribdat.cc/).
