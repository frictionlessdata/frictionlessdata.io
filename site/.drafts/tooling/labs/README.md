Under the Frictionless Data umbrella, there are several useful tools and ideas that are contributed by the core team and the wider community, but that are not yet fully fleshed out as stable solutions. In general, we take an approach of rough consensus and running code, and any or all of these tools could be further developed as we as a community work on new projects and use cases that require a "frictionless" approach to data.
 
## Labs tools
 
### Data Curator
 
Data Curator is a simple desktop data editor to help describe, validate and share usable open data. It uses [Table Schema](/products/table-schema/) and [Data Package](/products/data-package/) to import and export data, and also for the internal representation of data.

### Data Quality Dashboard and CLI
 
The Data Quality Dashboard (and its accompanying [CLI](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/data-quality-cli)) provide a simple way to visualize the data quality of a collection of data. There are methods to automatically ingest all tabular data on a given CKAN endpoint, and to provide a custom collection of data. The state of the data quality for each file is saved, so that change over time can be tracked.
