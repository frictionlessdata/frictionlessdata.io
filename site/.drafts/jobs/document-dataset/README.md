title: Document Dataset
tagline: Human and machine readable documentation of a dataset.
description: You want to have standard ways of documenting what a dataset is about, how it was collected, attribute names and values.
pain: Initially, you may do this in a Google Doc or in a Markdown file versioned with Git. Over time, the Frictionless Data-way is to document together with the dataset, following the Data Package specification.
context: Generally neglected, you should start thinking about this as soon as the project starts. Your future self will thank you.
