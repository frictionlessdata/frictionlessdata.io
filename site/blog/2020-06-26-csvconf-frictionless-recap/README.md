[csv,conf,v5](https://csvconf.com/), which occurred virtually in May 2020, featured several talks about using Frictionless Data, and was also organized by two members of the Frictionless Data team, Lilly Winfree and Jo Barratt. csv,conf is a community conference that brings diverse groups together to discuss data topics, and features stories about data sharing and data analysis from science, journalism, government, and open source. Over the years we have had over a hundred different talks from a huge range of speakers, most of which you can still watch back on our [YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/csvconf).

COVID-19 threw a wrench in our plans for csv,conf,v5, and we ended up converting the conference to a virtual event. We were looking forward to our first conference in Washington DC, but unfortunately, like many other in-person events, this was not going to be possible in 2020. However, there were many positive outcomes of moving to a virtual conference. For instance, the number of attendees quadrupled (over 1000 people registered!) and people were able to attend from all over the world. 

During the conference, there were several talks showcasing Frictionless Data. Two of the Frictionless Data Fellows, Monica Granados and Lily Zhao, presented a talk (“[How Frictionless Data Can Help You Grease Your Data](https://youtu.be/tZmu5DGPRmA)”) that had over 100 people watching live, which is many more than would have been at their talk in person. Other related projects gave talks that incorporated Frictionless Data, such as Christina Gosnell and Pablo Virgo from Catalyst Cooperative discussing “[Getting climate advocates the data they need.](https://youtu.be/ktLTC7SENHk)” I also recommend watching “[Data and Code for Reproducible Research](https://youtu.be/3Ban-orpVtc)” by Lisa Federer and Maryam Zaringhalam, and “[Low-Income Data Diaries - How “Low-Tech” Data Experiences Can Inspire Accessible Data Skills and Tool Design](https://youtu.be/XV_jxbB1cBY)” by David Selassie Opoku. You can see the full list of talks, with links to slides and videos, on the csv,conf website: [https://csvconf.com/speakers/](https://csvconf.com/speakers/).

We hope to see some of you next year for csv,conf,v6!
