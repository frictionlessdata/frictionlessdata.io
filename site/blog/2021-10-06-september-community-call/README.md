On our last Frictionless Data community call on September 30<sup>th</sup> we had Daniella Lowenberg from Dryad and developer Cassiano Reinert Novais dos Santos giving a presentation on the Frictionless Data integration into Dryad.

Dryad is a community-led repository that makes research data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. To ensure the quality of the submitted data, Dryad needs to curate it. It therefore made total sense to integrate the Frictionless Data validation functionality to its uploading page. 

A pilot was started at the beginning of 2021 to add an automatic tabular data validation check to all uploaded files under 25MB, and it went live in June 2021. Since then, more than 11000 research data files have been validated, and around 1000 failed the validation test. 98,4% of the researchers whose files failed, managed to fix their errors easily and resubmit their data.

All the code of the Frictionless Data integration is open source and lives in the [Dryad GitHub repository](https://github.com/orgs/CDL-Dryad/repositories), so go and have a look if you want and please let us know if you have any feedback.

You can learn more on the project [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/08/09/dryad-pilot/).
