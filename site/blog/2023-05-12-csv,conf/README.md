On April 19, 20 we attended csv,conf,v7, the best community conference for datamakers from all around the world! It was two days of fantastic talks, llamas (of course!), and above all, vibrant community encounters. We met long term friends, community members, and made new meaningful connections. Our tech lead Evgeny Karev gave a talk on April 19th to present the beta version of the Frictionless Application, making it easier for non-coders to use all the Frictionless resources, helping them improve the quality of their data. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or citizen analyst, the Frictionless Application empowers you to effortlessly describe, validate, extract, and transform data, all in one user-friendly environment. If you want to have a look at the presentation of the Frictionless Application by Evgeny Karev, you can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/hk1PoedLOY4).  

Also, we can't help but feel a sense of pride that Frictionless Data got mentioned in three different talks:

**Miller: A Swiss-Army Chainsaw for CSV and More by John Kerl:**
John Kerl took the stage to introduce Miller, a powerful tool that simplifies working with CSV and other data formats. In his talk, he acknowledged the synergy between Miller and Frictionless Data. He highlighted how Frictionless Data's specifications and tooling provided a solid foundation for Miller's capabilities, enabling users to effortlessly manipulate and analyse CSV files. The collaboration between Miller and Frictionless Data is a testament to the community's commitment to making data workflows smoother and more efficient.
You can watch (unfortunately) only parts of the recordings [here](https://youtu.be/G0_rFYz6rJg).

**Integrating Data Sources and Publishing Open Data with FastELT & Airflow by Augusto Herrmann:**
Augusto Herrmann, who is part of our community and whom you probably have met at one of our monthly calls, gave a talk on integrating data sources and publishing open data using FastELT and Airflow. During his presentation, Augusto emphasised the crucial role of Frictionless Data in ensuring data quality and interoperability. By implementing Frictionless Data's specifications and tooling, he showcased how FastELT and Airflow can seamlessly process, validate, and transform data, simplifying the data integration process and making open data publishing a breeze.

**Defining The Turing Way by Malvika Sharan, Melissa Black, and Esther Plomp:**
Malvika Sharan, Melissa Black, and Esther Plomp discussed The Turing Way, an initiative aimed at providing reproducible, ethical, and inclusive research practices. In their talk, Frictionless Data was acknowledged as a useful tool to achieve these goals. By adopting Frictionless Data's principles and tools, researchers can ensure data integrity, enhance collaboration, and promote openness in their work.

And if you are interested in knowing more about the Turing Way, go and [have a look at the recap blog](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/05/05/april-community-call/) of the community call of April last year, with Turing Way’s community manager Anne Steele.
