On our second community call of the year, on February 24<sup>th</sup>, we had Ilya Kreymer and Ed Summers from [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net/) updating us on their effort in standardising the WAZC format (which they discussed with us already when it was still at an early development stage, in the community call of December 2020 (you can read the blog [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2020/12/17/december-virtual-hangout/#a-recap-from-our-december-community-call)). 

Webrecorder is a suite of open source tools and packages to capture interactive websites and replay them at a later time as accurately as possible. They created the WACZ format to have a portable format for archived web content that can be distributed and contain additional useful metadata about the web archives, using the Frictionless Data Package standard.

Ed & Ilya also hoped to discuss with the community the possibility of signing these Data Packages, in order to provide an optional mechanism to make web archives bundled in WACZ more trusted, because a cryptographic proof of who the author of a Data Package is might be interesting for other projects as well. Unfortunately the call was rather empty. Maybe it was because of the change of time, but in case there are other reasons why you did not come, please let us know (dropping an email at sara.petti@okfn.org or with a direct message on Discord/Matrix).

We did record the call though, so in case anyone is interested in having that discussion, we could always try to have it asynchronously on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Sewv6av) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#frictionless-data:matrix.org).

Their current proposal to create signed WACZ packages is summarised in [on GitHub](https://github.com/webrecorder/wacz-auth-spec/blob/main/spec.md), so you can always reach out to them there as well.
# Join us next month!
Next community call is on March 31<sup>st</sup>. We are going to hear from Johan Richer from Multi, who is going to present the latest prototype of Etalab and his theory of [portal vs catalogue](https://jailbreak.gitlab.io/investigation-catalogue/synthese.html#/3)

You can sign up for the call already [here:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuNCopxXauMkrWvF6VHqOyHMcy54SfNDOseVXfWRQZWkvqjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
