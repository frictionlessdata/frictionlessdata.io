On our last Frictionless Data community call on October 28<sup>th</sup> we had Michael Amadi from Nimble Learn giving a presentation on Open Data Blend and their Frictionless Data journey.

Open Data Blend is a set of open data services that aim to make large and complex UK open data easier to analyse. The Open Data Blend datasets have two interfaces: a UI and an API, both powered by Frictionless Data. The datasets themselves are built on top of three Frictionless Data specifications: data package, data resource and table schema; and they incorporate some Frictionless Data patterns. 

The project addresses some of the main open data challenges:
* Large data volumes that are difficult to manage due to their size
* Overwhelming complexity in data analysis
* Open data shared in sub-optimal file formats for data analysis (e.g. PDFs)
* When companies and organisation aggregate data, refine it and add value to it, they often don’t openly share the cleaned data

You can learn more on the project [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/07/12/open-data-blend/). If you would like to dive deeper and discover all about how Open Data Blend uses the Frictionless Data toolkit, you can watch Michael Amadi’s presentation here:
