On June 30<sup>th</sup> we had a very special community call. Instead of a project presentation this time we had the chance to meet the 3rd cohort of [Frictionless Fellows](http://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/) and hear about their reproducibility and open science journey. 

The fellows are a group of early career researchers interested in learning about open science and data management by using the Frictionless Data tools in their own research projects. Melvin Adhiambo, Lindsay Gypin, Kevin Kidambasi, Victoria Stanley, and Guo-Qiang Zhang are almost at the end of their nine months fellowship. During the past nine months they have learnt open science principles and how to discuss them (especially  with colleagues who are not convinced yet!). They also learnt data management skills, and how to correctly use metadata and data schemas. Besides using the Frictionless Data browser tools, there was also a coding component to the fellowship, as they used the Frictionless Python tools as well.

The Fellows also ran workshops and wrote great blog posts during the last nine months. You can read them [here](http://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/blog). 

If you are interested in knowing more about the fellowsâ€™ research field and what being a Frictionless Data Fellow meant for them, go and watch the full recording of the call:
