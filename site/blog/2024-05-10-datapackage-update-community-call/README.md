On our last community call was on April 25<sup>th</sup>, we continued discussing the Frictionless Standard update with community members. As a reminder, thanks to the generous support of [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/), the Frictionless core team, together with a working group composed of members of the community, is now working on a v2 of the Specs. Read the [announcement blog](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2023/11/15/frictionless-specs-update/) to know more about it.

## Working group discussion

We are very excited we are getting closer to the final **Data Package v2 release**! 

The first thing we talked about was the data representation model, and how to make distinction on data layers clearer. The discussion had started in GitHub  [PR 49](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/pull/49), and was elevated to community discussion. The discussion is linked to the categorical data proposal that Kyle has put together in GitHub [PR 62](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/pull/62). What we want to do is to cut the ambiguity as much as possible, and make things explicit. 

As Keith quite rightly pointed out, there are some aspects of the standards we are deciding upon without being totally sure about them. As a community we are leaning towards conservatism and avoiding breaking changes, but there are things we will need to try out as provisional and then either deprecate them if they donâ€™t work or support them by the Standard. The fact that we are going to version the Standard is going to be very helpful in that process.

Versioning was actually supposed to be the main topic of the call, but [the proposal we put together](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/pull/42) was actually approved by the working group before the call. 

For a full overview of the items that the working group tackled on the call, you can have a look at our [live tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/pull/39), or watch the recording linked here below.

A few issues were moved out of the draft release to be rather included [in the final release](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs/milestone/7), which is planned for June. One example is versioning, which was [discussed in the last call](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2024/03/01/community-call/#working-group-discussion). As versioning is a brand new element, it will require more time to be tackled. We are currently working on a solid proposal to discuss with the working group next month.
