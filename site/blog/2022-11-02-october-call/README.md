On our last community call on October 27<sup>th</sup>, we had our very own Frictionless Data developer Shashi Gharti presenting to the community the Frictionless Zenodo integration, to read and write data packages from and to Zenodo. 

The integration is currently in development, but we decided to present this feature already in order to gather feedback from the community. It was a great idea because we got a lot of very useful inputs from all of you. Also how wonderful to see the community! We had really missed you all in the last two months, since we had to cancel the September call.

Back to Shashi’s presentation: what is Zenodo? For those of you who don’t know it, Zenodo is an open repository, allowing researchers to deposit papers, datasets, software, reports, etc.

Many members of our community are active users of Zenodo, and have asked for a plugin which would make it easier to use Frictionless Data and Zenodo together. Since our aim with Frictionless Data is to make data more easily shareable, transportable and interoperable, this feature made a lot of sense. 

Similarly to [the GitHub integration Shashi presented in August](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/08/30/community-call-github-integration/), the Zenodo integration will work with Frictionless-py v5, and has 3 different features to write data, read data and create a catalog from multiple Zenodo entries, searchable

If you are interested in knowing more about the feature, have a look at Shashi’s presentation and demo:

If you use the Frictionless Framework v5 and its Zenodo integration, please let us know! We would love to hear what you think. And if you have any feedback, feel free to open an issue in the [repository](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/framework).

* Peter Desmet is co-organising a conference on biodiversity data on November 9th, with a focus on camera trap data, for which he uses Frictionless Data standards as you may remember from his presentation at [last year’s community call](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/11/23/november-community-call/). More info: https://www.gbif.org/event/f68927-b5c1-4ac8-a4ac-7d47645/exploring-camera-trap-data

* We published an article on the Frictionless Data standards, and we talked about some community projects too, like Libraries Hacked, data.gov.fr, dados.gov.br, and BCO-DMO. The article is part of Common Place, a space to discuss the digital infrastructures, cultures, and actions needed to distribute, constellate, and amplify knowledge for the public good. ​ Check it out: https://commonplace.knowledgefutures.org/pub/8x7oeawa/release/1?readingCollection=10ba8b01
