On our last Frictionless Data community call on May 29<sup>th</sup> we had Simon Tyrrell and Xingdong Bian from the Earlham Institute giving a presentation on Frictionless Data for Wheat. The project was developed during the Frictionless Toolfund 2020-2021.

Simon and Xingdong are part of the Designing Future Wheat, a research group studying how to increment the amount of wheat that is produced in a field in order to meet the global demand by 2050. To run the project, they collect a great amount of data and large scale datasets, which are shared with a great number of different users. Frictionless Data is used to make that data available, usable and interoperable for everyone.

You can learn more about the Designing Future Wheat project [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/03/05/frictionless-data-for-wheat/). If you would like to dive deeper and discover all about the Frictionless implementation, you can watch Simon’s and Xingdong’s presentation here:
