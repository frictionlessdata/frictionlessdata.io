Mark your calendars! Next Friday, 28 March 2025, the Open Knowledge Foundation will host **a new iteration of [The Tech We Want](https://okfn.org/en/events/the-tech-we-want-online-summit/) initiative** — an ambitious effort to reimagine how technology is built and used. This time focused on **the decade-long [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) project**, a progressive open-source framework for building data infrastructure – data management, data integration, data validation and data flows. The goal is to bring together maintainers, users, and contributors to discuss challenges, priorities, and governance for the project moving forward.

The Frictionless Data project aims to make it easier to work with data by reducing common data workflow issues (what we call friction). Its software and standards are the basis of many projects developed by the community all over the world, ranging from climate scientists, to humanities researchers, to government data centres. 

At the summit, successful cases and projects will be promoted, and there will be a **collective discussion about how such a long-running project adapts to the current context** and Open Knowledge’s current vision of technology.

## What to Expect 
👩🏽‍💻 The event will start with short presentations of Frictionless **use cases**, in order to have some examples of how Frictionless is used today.

🗣️ Open Knowledge’s Tech Lead, Patricio del Boca, will then briefly present **The Tech We Want** initiative, to share the current vision of technology that is driving all development efforts at OKFN today.

🤗 Following that, there will be a genuine **community discussion** on how to envision the future of the project with selected active members of the community leading the discussion.
