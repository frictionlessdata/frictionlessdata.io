The first edition of [Frictionless Data Community Hangout][announcement] held on 20 April 2020 and it was a huge success and a great time spent with members of the community. 
We had over 16 guests join the event - the highlight from this event was community interaction. We had several people ask questions regarding things they needed clarity on about Frictionless Data and people shared what they are currently working on.

The event started with members of the community doing introductions across the room so we get to know each other better. People were also interested in knowing:

-   how frictionless data is different from Pandas
-   how are we moving towards the Open Science direction

Another topic that surfaced was how people are using Frictionless Data. A great example here is Johan Richer’s use case. [Johan Richer](https://twitter.com/JohanRicher), who works with the Open Data France team, shared a proposal for building a community led project called [Table Schema Catalog](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2020/04/23/table-schema-catalog). This project will serve as a single source of truth and a collection of table schemas from different organizations making all table schemas discoverable and usable. Here’s a great opportunity for the community to show some support! Johan is looking for collaborators, so if this project sounds interesting to you, go find more details on the [Frictionless Data Forum](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/forum/issues/5) and get yourself involved.

Finally, we rounded up the hangout with Lilly from the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/) team. She shared information about the upcoming [CSV Conf](https://csvconf.com/) on May 13-14 2020 and [Frictionless Data Tool Fund](https://blog.okfn.org/2020/03/02/announcing-the-2020-frictionless-data-tool-fund/) which, by the way is still open for applications until May 17 2020.

The event went pretty well thanks to everyone that showed up - I think it's a great start to cultivating community growth on Frictionless Data. We've scheduled another hangout on May 21, 2020. **Early registration is on** [go register now](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMsf-qrrjopHtGZwMyM7tCmp_YyPlNms6wK) so you don't miss out. We are also opening up spots for people in the community to share what they are working on and anything related to Frictionless Data that'll benefit the entire community. If this sounds appealing to you - reach out to us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/Sewv6av) and we’ll set it up.
