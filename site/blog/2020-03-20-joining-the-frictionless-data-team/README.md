Hi there, My name is [Gift Egwuenu][gift] and I'm super excited to share I joined [Datopian](https://datopian.com/) as a Frontend Developer and Developer Evangelist! ðŸŽ‰

<!-- more -->

[Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io) is an open-source toolkit that brings simplicity and grace to the data experience. We want every Data Engineer or Data Scientist to know about it and benefit from it.

Part of my job involves spreading the word about Frictionless Data and encouraging community involvement by sharing what you can achieve with the toolkit ðŸ˜ƒ

My other day-to-day activities include the following and more:

* Working on Frictionless Data tools
* Working closely and interacting with the Frictionless Data Community via (chats, remote hangouts, and in-person events)
* Writing documentation, guide and blog posts for Frictionless Data

I'm glad I get to do this as a full-time job because I'm passionate about teaching and learning ðŸš€ and I'm excited to be a part of the [Frictionless Data community](https://frictionlessdata.io/) where I get to contribute, share, learn and interact with the data community.
