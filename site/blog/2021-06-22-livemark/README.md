We are very excited to announce that a new tool has been added to the Frictionless Data toolkit: Livemark. What is that? Livemark is a great tool that allows you to publish data articles very easily, giving you the possibility to see your data live on a working website in a blink of an eye.

## How does it work?

Livemark is a Python library generating a static page that extends Markdown with interactive charts, tables, scripts, and much much more. You can use the Frictionless framework as a `frictionless` variable to work with your tabular data in Livemark.

Livemark offers a series of useful features, like automatically generating a table of contents and providing a scroll-to-top button when you scroll down your document. You can also customise the layout of your newly created webpage.

## How can you get started?
Livemark is very easy to use. We invite you watch this great demo by developer Evgeny Karev:
