On January 27<sup>th</sup>, for the first Frictionless Data community call of the year, we heard a presentation on the Data Package Manager for CKAN (DPCKAN) from Francisco Alves - leader of the proactive transparency policy in the Brazilian State of Minas Gerais.

You may remember Francisco and DPCKAN from the [Frictionless Data Hackathon](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/10/13/hackathon-wrap/) back in October 2021, where his team won the hack with this very project.

## So what is DPCKAN? 

It all started with the will to publish all the raw data on the Fiscal Transparency portal of the State of Minas Gereis, which is built on a [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) instance, as open data following the Frictionless standards. 

Francisco and his team wanted to install a data package, and be able to work with it locally. They also wanted to have the ability to partially update a dataset already uploaded in CKAN without overwriting it (this particular feature was developed during the Hackathon). That’s how the Data Package Manager was born. It is now in active development.

## And what’s next?

Francisco and his team would like to:
* Make it possible to read a data package directly from CKAN, 
* Make CKAN Datastore respect the Frictionless table schema types
* Have human readable metadata visualisation
* Contribute back upstream to Frictionless Data, CKAN, etc. 

Franscisco also gave a quick demo of what the DPCKAN looks like. You can watch the full presentation (including the demo):
