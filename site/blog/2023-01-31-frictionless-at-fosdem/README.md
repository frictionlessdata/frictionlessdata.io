We are very excited to announce that we are going back to FOSDEM this year! Frictionless Data Technical Leader at Open Knowledge Foundation, Evgeny Karev, will give an overview of the main functionalities of the upcoming and much awaited Frictionless Application.

The talk will be featured in the Open Research Tools and Technology devroom, alongside other super interesting talks. Have a look at the schedule [here](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/open_research_tools_and_technology/) to know more. This devroom provides a place and time to discuss the issues related to the creation and usage of open research technologies, with the ambition to foster discussions between designers, developers and users, bridging multiple knowledge-based communities together, and with the broader FLOSS community.

While FOSDEM is going back to Brussels for a physical event this year, the decision was made to keep part of the programme online to allow a broader audience to join. The Frictionless Application overview will be online as well, so you can follow it and participate in the discussion from wherever you are, even if you are not in Brussels.

This will be our 4th year at FOSDEM, and we are very proud we have been part of the Open Research devroom since its creation 4 years ago. To celebrate this, let’s look back at some of the great moments we shared:

In 2020 Lilly Winfree presented on-site “Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research” (you can watch the video recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFgZTfCZu5U&t=317s)), a talk in which she discussed the technical ideas behind Frictionless Data for research, and showcased collaborative use cases, particularly the [BCO-DMO pilot](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2020/02/10/frictionless-data-pipelines-for-open-ocean/), which was quite new at the time. Lilly showed how implementing Frictionless Data tooling into their data ingest pipelines allowed BCO-DMO to integrate disparate data while maintaining quality metadata in an easy to use interface. You can find all the info about this talk into the FOSDEM archive [here](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/open_research_frictionless_data/).

In 2021, for the first online FOSDEM due to Covid 19, Carles Pina i Estany presented [Schema-collaboration](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/01/18/schema-collaboration/), an open tool for reproducible research that helps data managers and researchers to collaborate on documenting datasets, built using the Frictionless Data specifications and software. Schema-collaboration was developed during the 2020 Tool Fund. For the FOSDEM presentation Carles gave an overview of the tool and did a demo as well.
Find all the info (including a video recording of the presentation) on the FOSDEM archive [here](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/open_research_schema_collaboration/).

In 2022 our Technical Lead, Evgeny Karev, presented the newly released (at the time) [Livemark](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/06/22/livemark/), a tool to publish data articles with interactive tables, charts, and other elements very easily, without leaving a text editor.
Have a look at the presentation and find all the information about it on the FOSDEM archive [here](https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/open_research_livemark/).

And what about this year? We wanted to release the Frictionless Application for FOSDEM, but we had to push that back a little bit. But as we said above, Evgeny is still giving [an overview of the Application](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/room/dresearch/) and some of its main features, which you should definitely not miss! See you online on Saturday, and happy FOSDEM weekend to you all!
