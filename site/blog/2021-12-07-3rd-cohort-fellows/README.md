We are very excited to introduce you to the 3rd cohort of [Frictionless Data Reproducible Research Fellows](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/)! Over the coming months, this group of six early career researchers will be learning about open science, data management, and how to use Frictionless Data tooling in their work to make their data more open and their research more reusable. Keep an eye on them, as they are on their way to becoming champions of reproducibility! For now, go and read the introductory blogs they wrote about themselves to know more about them and their goals for this fellowship.

**Hi, everyone! My name is Guo-Qiang Zhang**, and I am from China. Right after I finished my residency training in Pediatrics, I joined Prof Bright I. Nwaru’s group and started my doctoral studies at Krefting Research Centre in University of Gothenburg (Sweden). My doctoral project is to look at the effects of sex hormones on women’s health (especially asthma), utilizing epidemiological methods as well as evidence synthesis tools (e.g., systematic review, umbrella review). 

In my first year of doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to participate in the course “Reproducibility in Medical Research” led by Prof Nwaru. It was my first time to hear about Open Science and research reproducibility. As a “fresh” full-time doctoral student full of passion for medical research, I felt overwhelmed by waves of frustration when I came to know the reproducibility crisis. After spending some time with my frustration, I came to realize that in fact I can do something. In my first project, my colleagues and I conducted an umbrella review on a highly controversial topic on the impact of menopausal hormone therapy on women’s health. We put extensive efforts into making the review process as transparent as possible: we developed beforehand protocols for data extraction and statistical analysis, documented key steps of the review process, verified data in the published literature, and made all datasets and R scripts publicly available.

**Hi all! My name is Victoria**. I'm a physics graduate student and recovering engineer living in Berlin. I grew up mainly in my family’s native country of Singapore, but consider myself an American, and am still workshopping a straightforward answer to “where are you from.”

In my past life I worked in materials QA testing; currently, I’m at the German Aerospace Centre designing laser systems in the THz range - a type of non-visible light that hangs out on the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared and microwave. 

My Open Science journey has just begun and I’m stoked! I started to get interested in topics around data transparency and accessibility after a series of escalating frustrations with information dynamics in medical technology, beginning in my own field of gas sensing, then discovering similar disparities in tangential fields.

**Hello everybody! My name is Zarena**. I grew up in the Kyrgyz Republic, yet spent half of my life studying and working abroad. Currently, I am a Research Assistant for the project Creating Culturally Appropriate Research Ethics in Central Asia (CARE) at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan. I am also a Mad activist and an interdisciplinary human rights researcher. I like to consider my research activities going beyond academia to encompass and make an effect on broader socio-political structures.

Although I believe that life would not progress without frictions, when it comes to science and research, I feel, ‘frictions' - manifested in a form of paywalls, bureaucratic and corporate management, or other structural barriers - should be deconstructed. So, I am joining the Frictionless Data Fellowship Programme with the purpose to learn more about open and FAIR research.

**Hi everyone, my name is Melvin Ochieng**, and I'm a pathologist and up-coming soil scientist. I was born in Kenya in a town called Eldoret that is famous for producing Kenyan marathon champions. I was raised in Kenya in my early childhood days and in Tanzania afterwards. I like to consider myself both Kenyan and Tanzanian at heart because the two countries took part in molding the person I am today. I am currently a masters student at University of Mohammed VI polytechnic in Morocco, studying fertilizer science and technology. Over the past two years, my research focused on potato cyst nematode (PCN) which is a quarantine pest that had been reported in Kenya in 2015.

I'm excited to start this journey as a Frictionless Data fellow with my fellows for this cohort. I just recently found out about open science and I couldn't be more excited to learn more about this concept and how it will influence me as a researcher. Advancement in technology has opened up the world in so many ways and made possible extensive networks for collaborations globally. Notably, the problems the world is facing today require a global/collaborative approach to solve. Therefore, reproducible research is of key importance in promoting this collaboration.

**Hello! My name is Kevin Kidambasi**(KK). I was born and raised in Vihiga County of western Kenya. Currently, I live in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. I am a master’s student in Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) registered at the department of Biochemistry. My MSc research at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) focuses on the role of haematophagous camel-specific biting keds (Hippobosca camelina) in disease transmission in Laisamis, Marsabit County of northern Kenya. My broad research interest focuses on studying host-pathogen interactions to understand infection mechanisms of diseases in order to discover novel control and treatment targets.

I am interested in improving research reproducibility because it allows other researchers to confirm the accuracy of my data and correct any bias as well as validate the relevance of the conclusions drawn from the results. This also allows data to be analyzed in different ways and thus, give new insights and lead the research in new directions. In addition, improving research reproducibility would allow the scientific community to understand how the conclusions of a study were made and pinpoint out any mistakes in data analyses. In general, research reproducibility enhances openness, research collaboration, and data accessibility which in turn increase public trust in science and hence permits their participation and support for research. This enables public understanding of how research is conducted and its importance.

**Greetings! My name is Lindsay Gypin**, she/her. I grew up in Denver, Colorado and began my career as a K-12 educator. I taught high school English and worked as a school librarian before becoming disillusioned with the politicization of public education and determining my skills were better suited for work in public libraries. Attending library school after having worked in libraries for so many years, I found myself drawn to courses in the research data management track of librarianship, and in qualitative research methods.I recently became a Data Services Librarian at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, where I hope to assist scholars in making their research data more open and accessible.

For some time, I have wanted to build a reproducible workflow to uncover systemic bias in library catalogs. I’m hoping the Fellows Programme will help me build the foundation to do so.
