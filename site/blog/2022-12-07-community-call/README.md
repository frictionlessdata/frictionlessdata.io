On our last community call on December 1<sup>st</sup>, we heard about the new Frictionless Data - CKAN integration from senior developer Edgar Zanella.

Being a much awaited and longterm requested integration from the community, there are several projects aiming at integrating Frictionless Data with CKAN:

1. **Datapackager CKAN Extension** - allowing the import of Data Packages directly to CKAN, and the export of any dataset in your portal as a Data Package
2. **CKAN Validation Extension** - providing all the Frictionless Framework validation functionalities to your CKAN portal
3. **CKAN Data Portal** supported by Frictionless Framework - providing an easy way to load Data Packages to and from your CKAN portal, using CKAN control
4. **Frictionless CKAN Mapper** - a small Python library working behind the scenes to convert datasets formats from CKAN to Frictionless Packages, and vice versa.

Check out Edgar’s presentation to know more about these projects and to see them demoed:
