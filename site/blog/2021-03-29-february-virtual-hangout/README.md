## A recap from our March community call
On our last Frictionless Data community call on March 25<sup>th</sup>, we dealt with a very current topic thanks to Thorben Westerhuys, who presented his project on Frictionless Vaccination data.

To compensate for the lack of time perspective in the government data, Thorben has developed a spatiotemporal tracker for state level covid vaccination data, which  takes the data provided by the government, reformats it and makes it available to everyone in a structured, more machine readable form.

To discover more about this great project, have a look at it on [GitHub](https://github.com/n0rdlicht/rki-vaccination-scraper). If you would like to dive deeper and discover all the project’s applications, you can watch Thorben’s presentation here:
