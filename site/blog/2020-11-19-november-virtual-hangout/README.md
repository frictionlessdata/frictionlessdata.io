## A recap from our November community call

This time around, we were offered a fantastic presentation by Costas Simatos, the team leader of the [ISA<sup>2</sup> Interoperability Test Bed Action](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed) at the European Commission! He revealed some powerful tools to validate data against specifications, including the following:

- A [Table Schema validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/json/tableschema/upload), sharing a [news article](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/news/table-schema-validator) about it;
- More validators to work with [XML](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/validatingXML/), [RDF](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/validatingRDF/), [JSON](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/validatingJSON/) and [CSV](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/docs/guides/latest/validatingCSV/) (based on a fork of [tableschema-java](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-java)) as well as a [custom CSV validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/csv/kohesio/upload) built for [Kohesio](https://kohesio.eu/), the _"Project Information Portal for Cohesion Policy"_;
- A feature-rich [conformance testing platform](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/itb/).
