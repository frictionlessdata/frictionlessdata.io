At our last community call on May 28<sup>th</sup>, we heard about citizen science and climate change solutions using Frictionless Data from Nick Kellett, Pan Khantidhara and Justin Mosbey from [Deploy Solutions](https://www.deploy.solutions/).

Deploy Solutions builds software that can help with climate change disruptions, and they are using Frictionless Data to help! They develop cloud-hosted solutions using big data from satellites, and, since 2019, they have adopted a citizen focus in climate change research. 
They researched and identified the main problems that prevent people and communities from acting in case of climate change disasters:

* Citizens feel overwhelmed by the volume of information received.
* They feel the information they get is not personalised to their needs.
* Authorities have difficulties directly collaborating and sharing information with citizens.

The solution they propose is the creation of a complete map-centred web-application that can be built very quickly (~4 hours) with basic functionalities to provide basic and reliable information for disaster response, while allowing users to upload citizen science observations.

The app takes Earth observations imagery from satellites, and associates them with imagery that citizens are taking on the ground, to check that the machine learning algorithms applied are correctly predicting the disaster extent. 

It also visualises the data coming in to look for trends, gathering historic data and comparing with what is predicted. The quantity of information needed for such an app is huge, and most often than not, it comes from different sources and does not follow any standards. It is therefore tricky to describe it and validate it. You might have guessed it by now, Frictionless Data is helping with that.

If you are interested in knowing more about Deploy Solutions and how they are using Frictionless Data, you can watch the full presentation (including Pan Khantidharaâ€™s demo!):
