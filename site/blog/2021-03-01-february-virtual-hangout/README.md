## A recap from our February community call

On this February Community Call we had a top notch code demonstration of the new frictionless.py framework by our Frictionless Data senior developer Evgeny Karev. We had been looking very much forward to presenting the new framework to you all and we were very pleased that so many of you joined us. If you would like to know more about it, you can explore the new Frictionless Python framework through the [documentation portal](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py).

If you couldnâ€™t make it to the call, or you are just curious and would like to go over the presentation again, here it is:
