Guided by our commitment to make research data publishing more seamless and also re-usable, we are thrilled to partner with Open Knowledge Foundation and the Frictionless Data team to enhance our submission processes. Integrating the Frictionless Data toolkit, Dryad will be able to directly provide feedback to authors on the structure of tabular files uploaded. This will also allow for automated file level metadata to be created at upload and available for download for published datasets.

We are excited to get moving on this project and with support from the Sloan Foundation, Open Knowledge Foundation has just announced a job opening to contribute to this work. Please check out the posting and circulate it to any developers who may be interested in building out this functionality with us: https://okfn.org/about/jobs/

*Stay tuned for a project update in July 2021!*
