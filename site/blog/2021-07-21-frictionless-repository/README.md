Are you looking for a way to automate the validation workflows of your datasets? Look no further, Frictionless Repository is here! 

We are very excited to announce that a new tool has been added to the Frictionless Data toolkit: Frictionless Repository. This is a Github Action allowing the continuous data validation of your repository and it will ensure the quality of your data by reporting any problems you might have with your datasets in no time.

## How does it work?

Every time you add or update any tabular data file in your repository, Frictionless Repository runs a validation. Missing header? Data type mismatch? You will get a neat, visual,  human-readable validation report straight away, which will show any problems your data may have. The report lets you spot immediately where the error occurred, making it extremely easy to correct it. You can even get a Markdown Badge to display in your repository to show that your data is valid.

Frictionless Repository only requires a simple installation. It is completely serverless, and it doesn't rely on any third-party hardware except for the Github infrastructure. 

## Let’s go!

Before you get started, have a look at developer Evgeny Karev’s demo:
