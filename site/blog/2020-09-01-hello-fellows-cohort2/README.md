We are very excited to introduce the newest Fellows for Cohort 2 of the Frictionless Data [Reproducible Research Fellows Programme](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/)! Over the next nine months, these eight early career researchers will be learning about open science, data management, and how to use Frictionless Data tooling in their work to make their data more open and their research more reusable. As an introduction, each Fellow has written a short blog about themselves and their goals. Read below to meet the Fellows and click on their individual blogs to learn more about them!

**Hi everyone, my name is Katerina Drakoulaki**, I am from Greece and Cyprus, and I’m currently doing my PhD at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. My PhD combines all my interests: linguistics, language disorders, music cognition, and working with children! Research reproducibility is important in order to reliably identify and provide intervention to children with difficulties.

**Hello everybody! I'm Evelyn Night**, an MSc student at the [University of Nairobi](https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/) and a research fellow at the [International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology](http://www.icipe.org/). Growing up in a tiny village in Kano plains of Western Kenya, I always had a passion for learning. Fast forward through the years I find my way into academia pursuing a master’s degree and characterizing insect pollinator communities using morphometric and molecular tools for my thesis. My goal is to improve agricultural research capacity in the country and to also enhance formation of policies that would ensure increase in agricultural productivity.

**Hi everyone! I'm Dani**, a cognitive neuroscientist and open science enthusiast. I live and work in San Sebastian, a beautiful city by the sea in northern Spain. We have a responsibility to overcome the current incentive system in the Academy to provide more honest, accessible, and quality research. I look forward to learning more about Frictionless Data tools and incorporating them into my work so that my research is open to everyone.

**Hello hi! I’m Kate Bowie**, a 28-year-old midwesterner studying the human microbiome, or the collection of bacteria that live in and on the human body. As I dive deeper into the field of microbiome science, I am becoming an advocate for putting resources and time into improving research reproducibility. I wanted to become a Frictionless Fellow so that I could learn tools to help microbiome science data workflows become more reproducible and engage in the open science community.

**Hello! My name is Sam Wilairat.** I am currently earning a Master of Library and Information Science degree (MLIS) and have an interest in data librarianship. As a fellow, I’m hoping to learn frictionless data principles and tools to ultimately promote them at my institution via education and outreach to researchers. I believe Open Science is the future and the more people embrace it, the more equitable and innovative research will be!

**Hey everyone, I'm Anne!** I’m a graduate student based in Geneva, Switzerland that was born and bred in a few places across the United States (including New York, Chicago, Houston, and Washington DC!). Here in Switzerland, I study international institutions with the eye of an anthropologist or sociologist, through long-term ethnographic research. I’m excited to learn how to apply the Frictionless Data tools in my work throughout these nine months, and to experiment with new forms of conveying social science research in the process.

**Hi Ritwik here!** I am based near Delhi, India and am doing my masters in Sustainable buildings, Energy conservation and Climate Change from International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad. It is very important that the research which is carried in this domain is reproducible and available to all so we can use it to spread awareness among people.

<img src="/img/blog/jacqueline-fellow.jpg" alt="Jacqueline picture" width="100px" align="right">

**Hi! My name is Jacqueline.** I am a Master’s Candidate and Interdisciplinary Innovation Fellow in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I applied to be a Reproducible Research Fellow to build space into my research process for actively exploring open science and reproducibility issues. As a scientist, I consider it an obligation to share my knowledge as widely and freely as possible and to ensure that my findings can be vetted through replication studies and other important checks.
