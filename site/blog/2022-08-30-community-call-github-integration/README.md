On the last community call on August 25<sup>th</sup>, we had our very own Frictionless Data developer Shashi Gharti presenting to the community the new Frictionless GitHub integration, to read and write data packages from/to GitHub repositories.

Besides reading and writing packages, the integration also allows the creation of containers for data packages: the [catalog](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/docs/framework/catalog.html), a list of packages from multiple repositories in GitHub. To select which repository you want to be in the catalog, you can use any GitHub qualifier.

The Frictionless GitHub integration is part of the beta release of [Frictionless Framework version 5](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/08/29/frictionless-framework-release/). 

If you are interested in knowing more about the Frictionless GitHub integration, have a look at Shashi’s presentation and demo:
