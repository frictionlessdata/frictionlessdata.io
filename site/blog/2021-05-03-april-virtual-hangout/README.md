On our last Frictionless Data community call on April 29<sup>th</sup> we had an interactive session with our great Frictionless Data Fellows: Daniel Alcalá López, Kate Bowie, Katerina Drakoulaki, Anne Lee, Jacqueline Maasch, Evelyn Night and Samantha Wilairat.

The Fellows are early career researchers recruited to become champions of the Frictionless Data tools and approaches in their field. During the nine months of their fellowship, which started in August 2020, the Fellows learned how to use Frictionless tools in their domains to improve reproducible research workflows, and how to advocate for open science. It was a real pleasure to work with this amazing cohort. Sadly the fellowship is coming to an end, but we are sure we will hear a lot from them in the future.

You can learn more about them [here](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/), and read all the great blogs they wrote [here](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/blog/).

If you would like to hear directly from the Fellows about their experience with Frictionless Data and what the fellowship meant for them, you can have a look at the presentation they made during the community call here below:

## News from the Community

Oleg Lavrovsky presented instant APIs for small Frictionless Data-powered apps. [Here](https://scene.rip/) is an example app developed during the latest Swiss OpenGLAM hackathon. To know more about it, you can also check:

* The [source code](https://github.com/we-art-o-nauts/the-scene-lives) which uses [DataFlows](https://github.com/datahq/dataflows) for the aggregation, and the [Pandas Data Package reader](https://github.com/rgieseke/pandas-datapackage-reader) as the basis for filtering.
* The [project page](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/114) and slides which outline the motivation to collect and homogenize electronic art archives.
* An [earlier attempt](https://github.com/loleg/baumkataster-data) which involves a city tree catalogue. The team is also building on this approach in several projects at [cividi](http://github.com/cividi).

## Join us next month!
