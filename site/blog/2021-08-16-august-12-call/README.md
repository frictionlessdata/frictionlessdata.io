On our last Frictionless Data community call on August 12<sup>th</sup> we had Dave Rowe (aka Libraries Hacked) giving a presentation on Frictionless Data standards and tooling for public libraries’ data. 

Libraries Hacked is a project promoting open data in libraries and creating digital prototypes from that data. Public libraries hold a lot of data, but this data is often not shared and it is lacking common standards for data sharing. With the introduction of data schemas, Dave developed a series of tools to show libraries what they could do with their data. For example, Dave demonstrated membership mapping, libraries maps and a [mobile libraries dashboard](https://www.mobilelibraries.org/map) that displays mobile libraries vans, estimates their location and automatically generates paper timelines.

You can learn more about the Libraries Hacked project [here](https://www.librarieshacked.org/).  If you would like to dive deeper and discover all about what you can do with Frictionless library data, , you can watch Dave Rowe’ presentation here::
