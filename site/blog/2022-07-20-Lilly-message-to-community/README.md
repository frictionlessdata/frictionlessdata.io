Dear Frictionless community,

I’m writing to let you all know that this is my final week working on Frictionless Data with Open Knowledge Foundation. It has been a true pleasure to get to interact with you all over the last four years! Rest assured that Frictionless Data is in good hands with the team at Open Knowledge (Evgeny, Sara, Shashi, Edgar, and the rest of the OKF tech team).

What’s next for me? I’m still staying in the data space, moving to product at data.world (did you know they export data as datapackages?)! Maybe you’ll see me presenting a demo at an upcoming Frictionless community call ;-) 

If you’ll allow me to reminisce for a few minutes, here are some of my favourite Frictionless memories from my time working on this project:

**The Frictionless Hackathon:** In October 2021, we hosted the first-ever Frictionless Hackathon (virtually of course), and it was so cool to see all the projects and contributors from around the world! You can read all about it in [the summary blog here](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/10/13/hackathon-wrap/). Should we do another Hackathon? Let Sara know what you think! (Special shout-out to Oleg who set up the Hackathon software and inspired the entire event!) 

**Pilot collaborations**: We started our first Reproducible Research pilot collaboration with the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) team in 2019, and learned so much from this implementation! This resulted in a new data processing pipeline for BCO-DMO data managers that used Frictionless to reproducibly clean and document data. This work ultimately led to the creation of the Frictionless Framework. You can check out all the other [Pilots on the Adoption page](https://frictionlessdata.io/adoption/#pilot-collaborations) too.

**Fellows**: Getting to mentor and teach 17 Fellows was truly a spectacular experience. These current (and future) leaders in open science and open scholarship are people to keep an eye on – they are brilliant! You can read all about their experience as Fellows on [their blog](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/blog/).

**The Frictionless Team at OKF**: I’ve been very lucky to get to work with the best team while being at OKF! Many of you already know how helpful and smart my colleagues are, but in case you don’t know, I will tell you! Evgeny has been carefully leading the technical development of Frictionless with a clear vision, making my job easy and fun. Sara has transformed how the community feels and works, which is no small feat! Shashi and Edgar have only been working on the project for less than a year, but their contributions to the code base and to help answer questions have already made a big impact! I will miss working with these excellent humans, and all of you in the community that have made Frictionless a special place!

Thank you all for being a part of the Frictionless community and for working with me in the past! I wish you all the best, and maybe I will see some of you in Buenos Aires in April for [csv,conf,v7](https://csvconf.com/)?

Cheers!
