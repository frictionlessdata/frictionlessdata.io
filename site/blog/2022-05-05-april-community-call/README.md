At our last community call on April 28<sup>th</sup>, we had a discussion around open science best practices and the Turing Way with Anne Lee Steele, who - you might remember, was part of the [second cohort of Frictionless Fellows](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2020/09/01/hello-fellows-cohort2/).

The Turing Way is an open source and community-led handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research. It is composed of more than 240 pages created by ~300 researchers over the course of 3 years, written collaboratively via GitHub PRs - contrasting to the notion of single/small-authorship papers.

There is currently an effort to make the Turing way develop meta-practices that can be applied to other areas as well, one example is documentation.

A great outcome of the call was the proposal to have a closer cooperation between the Frictionless Data community and the Turing Way’s one, possibly developing a chapter for Open Infrastructures for research to contribute upstream. This chapter would set the context and provide a vision for how to evaluate tools and platforms with a Turing Way perspective on reproducibility, ethical alternatives and collaboration in practice. For more info about this proposal, check [this issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2337).

# News from the community

* You’re all invited to join the Frictionless Fellows for a free virtual workshop on Open Science best practices on May 25 at 2pm UTC!
In this beginner-friendly workshop, Fellows will demonstrate how to use the Frictionless tools to make research data more understandable, usable, and open. You will learn how to use the Frictionless non-coding tools to manipulate metadata and schemas (and why that is important!) and how to validate data in a hands-on format. Learn more & sign up on the Fellows website: [https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/).

* Reminder that our community chat has moved to Slack. Join us [there](https://join.slack.com/t/frictionlessdata/shared_invite/zt-17kpbffnm-tRfDW_wJgOw8tJVLvZTrBg). We now also have a fully operating [Matrix bridge](https://matrix.to/#/#frictionlessdata:matrix.okfn.org), so if you prefer you can join us from there as well.

# Join us next month!
Next community call is on May 26<sup>th</sup>. We are going to hear Nick Kellett from Deploy Solutions explain to us how to build citizen science and climate change solutions, using Frictionless.

You can sign up for the call already [here:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuNCopxXauMkrWvF6VHqOyHMcy54SfNDOseVXfWRQZWkvqjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
