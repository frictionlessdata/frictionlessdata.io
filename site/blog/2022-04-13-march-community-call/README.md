At our last community call on March 31<sup>st</sup>, we had a discussion with Johan Richer from [Multi](https://www.multi.coop/) around his theory of portal vs catalogue.

The discussion started with a presentation of the latest catalogue prototype by [Etalab](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/) currently in development: https://github.com/etalab/catalogage-donnees. Data cataloguing has become a major component of open data policies in France, but there are issues related to the maintainability of the catalogue and the traceability of the data.

In the beginning the data producers were also the data publishers, and therefore the purpose of a portal was to catalogue, publish, and store the data. Recently the process became more complicated, and the cataloguing became a prerequisite to publication. Instead of publishing by default, data producers want to make sure that the data is clean before injecting it into the portal. This started a new workflow of internal data management, that the portals were not made for. So how can we restore the broken link between catalogue and portal? Johan thinks data lineage is key.

If you want to know more about it, you can go and have a look at Johan’s presentation [here](https://jailbreak.gitlab.io/investigation-catalogue/synthese.html#/3) (in French, but [here’s a shortcut to the Google translation](https://jailbreak-gitlab-io.translate.goog/investigation-catalogue/synthese.html?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en#/) if you’d rather have it in English), or watch the recording:

# News from the community

Our community chat has moved from Discord to Slack! In the community survey we ran last year, many people suggested moving to Slack, and the terms of services are definitely better (ranking B vs E for Discord, according to https://tosdr.org/ ). We will also be able to organise the questions & answer better, and that will definitely be an added value for the community.
