On December 22<sup>nd</sup>, for our last community call of the year, we had a nice discussion with Oleg Lavrovsky, an old friend of Open Knowledge Foundation, board member of the Swiss chapter, and valued member of the Frictionless Data community, about Data Package as a Service.

Oleg together with Thorben Westerhuys (remember his [spatiotemporal covid 19 vaccination tracker he presented in March 2021](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/03/29/february-virtual-hangout/#a-recap-from-our-march-community-call)?) already made a first attempt at this in 2019, as you can see in this [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/datalets/daats). The repository works as a template to create a quick API around your Frictionless Data Package. This solution is based on the [Falcon micro framework](http://falconframework.org/) and the [Pandas Data Package Reader](https://github.com/rgieseke/pandas-datapackage-reader).

More recently Edgar Zanella from the Frictionless Data core team also worked on an [experimental solution](https://github.com/aivuk/datapackage-api), converting a Data Package to SQLite database and using [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) to have a [JSON API](https://github.com/aivuk/datapackage-api/) over the data. The advantage of this solution is that the way of querying the data is going to be familiar for those that knows [SQL](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html).

Then in November 2022, during the GLAMhack 2022 in Mendrisio, an API for Frictionless Data Packages was needed again to be able to sort data and view it on a map. The end result was a [Living Herbarium app](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/177).

So Oleg decided to pitch the idea of Frictionless Data Packages as services, as a challenge at the [DINAcon hacknights](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/project/60) in Bern. The challenge was not picked by anyone at the hackathon itself, but it sparked a conversation [in our community chat](https://frictionlessdata.slack.com/archives/C0369JLDJ1Z/p1668597797541189). 

If you are also interested in joining the conversation, just get on the thread in the community chat. If you need a bit of context, you can of course rewatch Olegâ€™s presentation:

It was also noted during the call that 2 other excellent ways to get a quick API for Frictionless Data Packages are:
* The [Flat Data project](https://githubnext.com/projects/flat-data), developed on top of an idea by Simon Willison, allows (among other things) to have a quick API for your Data Package.

* CKAN, since CKAN provides APIs. For example via [CKAN-embed](https://github.com/datalets/ckan-embed), a widget for embedding live data searches from CKAN data portals into external websites.

# Join us next month!
Next community call is on January 26<sup>th</sup> and we are going to hear about Frictionless Data and DCAT from Matteo Fortini.
