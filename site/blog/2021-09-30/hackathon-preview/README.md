The Frictionless Data Online Hackathon is fast approaching and we just can’t wait for it to start!

If you are not sure yet whether to participate or not, bear in mind that it will be a great opportunity to test some of the newest Frictionless tools, like Livemark, Repository, play around with Frictionless-py and other new Frictionless code. It will also be a great chance for you to meet other Frictionless users and contributors from all around the world and build a project prototype together.

**Not convinced yet? Go and explore the proposed projects on the [Dashboard](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/event/1#top)! You will see, there is a project for every taste, so surely there must be one that sounds right for you!**

Are you a big fan of geodata? In that case you will probably want to join the [frictionless-geojson team](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/9), who is planning to create a frictionless-py plugin to add support for reading, writing and inlining geojson. If you are a devoted CKAN user who would like to see more Frictionless functionalities in it, you may decide to join the [Data package manager for CKAN project](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/8).

In case you read our [blog about Livemark](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/06/22/livemark/) and have been intrigued by this new Frictionless tool ever since, your moment has come! You can finally try it out by joining the [Citation Context Reports](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/11), the [Dataset List](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/3) project, or the [Frictionless Community Insights](http://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/12) project. If you are interested in datasets discoverability and linkage, you may want to join the [Things not Datasets](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/10) team. 

Oh, and please let us know in advance if you are a big bugs smasher! You will be a coveted participant for all projects and we need to make sure everybody gets a fair share of your skills, including us in our effort to improve the [Frictionless Python Framework](https://frictionless-hackathon.herokuapp.com/project/4).

But enough of describing the projects, instead hear about them directly from the people who proposed them:
