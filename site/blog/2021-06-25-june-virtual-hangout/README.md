At our last Frictionless Data community call on June 24<sup>th</sup> we had Nikhil Vats giving a presentation on Frictionless Package for InterMine. The project was developed during the Frictionless Toolfund 2020-2021.

InterMine is an open source biological data warehouse that creates databases of biological data accessed by sophisticated web query tools. Nikhil worked on the Frictionless Data Package integration, which is extremely helpful for users, as it describes all the fields of their query, specifically: name of field, type of field, class path, field and class ontology link.

You can learn more about the Data Package for InterMine project [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/04/13/data-package-for-intermine/).  If you would like to dive deeper and discover all about the Frictionless implementation, you can watch Nikhil Vats’ presentation here:

## Other agenda items from our hangout

### Linked data support
Nikhil’s presentation naturally led to a discussion on adding support for linked data and ontologies to Frictionless Data. On several occasions the community has shown interest in extending Frictionless specifications by incorporating standard attributes like ontology terms for improved interoperability. There have also been several discussion about supporting JSON-LD or RDF in the main specifications for improved data linking and querying. Would this help your work? Let us know what you think and if you are potentially interested in participating in this project.

### New tool: Livemark
We are super happy to share with you the newest entry in the Frictionless Data toolkit: Livemark - a static page generator with built-in tables and charts support (with support for data processing and validation with Frictionless): https://frictionlessdata.github.io/livemark/

To know more about it, check out [our latest blog](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/06/22/livemark/) (featuring a great demo by developer Evgeny Karev).

As usual, we would love to hear what you think, so please share your thoughts, comments and feedback with us. 

# News from the community
Michael Amadi from Nimble Learn presented the [Open Data Blend project](https://www.opendatablend.io/) - a set of open data services that aim to make large and complex UK open data easier to analyse. Open Data Blend’s bulk data API is built on the Frictionless Data specs. Keep an eye out for an upcoming blog with more details!

Frictionless contributor Peter Desmet proposed to start a Frictionless Data community on Zenodo. We are currently discussing the best way to do that on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/j9DNFNw) in the *datasets* channel. Join us there if you are interested or have ideas!

# Join us next month!

Our next meeting will be on July 29<sup>th</sup>. We will hear a presentation from
