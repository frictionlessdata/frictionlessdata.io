On our last community call on May 30<sup>th</sup>, we continued discussing the Frictionless Standard update with community members. As a reminder, thanks to the generous support of [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/), the Frictionless core team, together with a working group composed of members of the community, is now working on a v2 of the Data Package standard and the Frictionless Specs. Read the [announcement blog](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2023/11/15/frictionless-specs-update/) to know more about it.

## Working group discussion

The final **Data Package v2 release** is getting closer and we are really excited about it! The release will happen in the last week of June. 

We only had a few issues left on the roadmap to discuss. So the call was slightly shorter than usual (and my choppy internet connection did not help!).

Here are the pending items:
* Adding a table property for the table dialect ([see PR](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/pull/64)) 
* Data representation model
* Categorical data (linked to the data representation model discussion above)
* Metadata in Table Schema ([see PR](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/pull/63))

While we discussed and progressed on the table property and the metadata in Table Schema, the data representation model and categorical data needed some extra thinking and discussion, so we agreed to continue the conversation on GitHub.

We also agreed we will discuss changes to implementations in the next call: Open Knowledge Foundation will take care of the Python Framework, Peter is already working on the R library, and Evgeny created a PR to add Data Package as an export format for Zenodo, Invenio RDM.

# Join us in June!
Next community call is on June 20<sup>th</sup>, exceptionally on the 3rd Thursday of the month instead of the last one. As this will be the last community call before the v2 Standard & Specs release, this call will be longer: 1,5 hour. We will use the time to review the documentation and discuss the next steps. Join us to hear all the exciting news about the [Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/) update!

# Thank you
On a final note, we would like to thank all community members that joined the call and that keep all these discussions alive, and particularly those who are putting a lot of thinking and hard work into the Data Package working group. Without you, all of this would not be possible.
