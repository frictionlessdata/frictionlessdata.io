After 2 long months of absence, our monthly community call was finally back on September 28<sup>th</sup>, with some very exciting news! Our Tech Lead Evgeny Karev presented the work that has absorbed so much of his and Shashi Gharti’s time in the last months: the Frictionless no-code application [Open Data Editor](https://opendataeditor.okfn.org/).

The problem that inspired this new tool is that still today there is no easy tool to manage and publish data for those who don't have technical skills. The new Open Data Editor offers the possibility to access all Frictionless functionalities without having to write one single line of code, nor open your shell. Like most Frictionless products, Open Data Editor focuses on tabular data, and it can easily open big files because it uses  the ``` database ```  under the hood (similarly to CKAN). You can use it to edit metadata, and declare some rules for opening that you can share with your collaborators, making your data more reproducible.

You can use it to create data visualisation with VegaLite, but Open Data Editor has also an AI support, which you can use to create charts for you, in case you don’t know how to use the VegaLite specifications. You can also publish data stories, and much much more! Check out Evgeny’s presentation to see all the great features of the Open Data Editor:

The application is still a work in progress, but if you would like to try it out that’s of course absolutely possible, and we would love it if you could give us feedback, so please let us know if you spot anything weird. To make the experience smoother, we have a detailed [documentation website](https://opendataeditor.okfn.org/documentation/getting-started/) you can consult.
