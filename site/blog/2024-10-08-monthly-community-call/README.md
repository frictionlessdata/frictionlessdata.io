On our last community call on September 26<sup>th</sup> we discussed with the community the Frictionless project and changes in the governance of the Python Framework.

The roadmap and maintenance of the Python Framework has been led until now by Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN), with precious contributions from the community. We would like now to expand the governance framework to include new maintainers outside of OKFN. Since the end of August we have been extremely happy to welcome Pierre Camilleri from [Multi.coop](https://www.multi.coop/?locale=fr), which builds FLOSS for public administrations, as new official maintainer of the Python Framework. Pierre also maintains [Validata](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2020/04/23/table-schema-catalog/), a wrapper of Frictionless offering custom checks for the French administration.

If you or anyone you know is interested in maintaining the Frictionless Framework, please get in touch. We don’t want to brag, but we are getting close to 1,000 stars on GitHub, if this can help motivate people!

As suggested by Peter Desmet, we will also prepare the codebase for peer review from the PyOpenSci community, which may also be able to support the maintenance.

All of those changes will be reflected on the website, on the [People page](https://frictionlessdata.io/people/), among others. While we are at it, we will also make the [Frictionless Universe page](https://frictionlessdata.io/universe/) more informative, by including for each library information about who the main authors and maintainers, the status (including GitHub stars), the features supported, downloads, and maybe adding a common API. Probably most of that information can be pulled from GitHub, in the same way [INBO](https://inbo.r-universe.dev/builds) does.

## Community discussion on the Data Package update:

Part of the [Data Package](https://datapackage.org/) update under the NLnet grant was to propose a Data Package integration to use as a data API for data repositories like Zenodo and CKAN. The proposals are in discussions with the relevant teams. 

We all agreed we need to build more links between Data Package and the FAIR principles. Steve Diggs and Phil Schumm proposed to build a working group around Data Package adoption, to spark the discussion around Data Package, not only with the people involved in data sharing, but also end-users and researchers to demonstrate how valuable Data Package can be for their own work, and how much efficiency it can bring even if one is just interested in doing secondary data analysis. As Peter Desmet rightly pointed out, while there are alternatives out there of other specs you could use instead of Data Package, their scope of use is often limited and they do not have software implementations. What makes Frictionless attractive is that it has been around for more than a decade and it has been used in many different areas, so it is general enough to suit everyone’s needs. We therefore started a [new channel on Slack](https://frictionlessdata.slack.com/archives/C0369JLDJ1Z) to discuss Data Package adoption, please join the discussion.

We also got an update from the categorical data working group (Kyle Husmann, Phil Schumm, Albert-Jan Roskam, and Jan van der Laan), who are building a new approach in the form of a recipe to allow to define data resources that are explicit categorical tables, with categorical codes and tables, and hierarchical information about the categories and rich metadata about the levels. If you are interested in being part of this discussion, please reach out to Kyle Husmann on Slack. They will present their work at the November community call.

# Join us in October!
Next community call is on October 31<sup>st</sup> (oh so spooky!). Keith Hughitt will be presenting. 

Do you have something you would like to present to the community at one of the upcoming calls? Let us know via [this form](https://forms.gle/AWpbxyiGESNSUFK2A), or come and tell us on our [community chat on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/frictionlessdata/shared_invite/zt-17kpbffnm-tRfDW_wJgOw8tJVLvZTrBg)(also accessible via a [Matrix bridge](https://matrix.to/#/#frictionlessdata:matrix.okfn.org) if you prefer to use an open protocol).

You can sign up for the call already [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuNCopxXauMkrWvF6VHqOyHMcy54SfNDOseVXfWRQZWkvqjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Do you want to share something with the community? Let us know when you sign up.
