## A recap from our January community call

On January 28<sup>th</sup> we had our first Frictionless Data Community Call for 2021. It was great to see it was so well attended!

We heard a presentation by Carles Pina i Estany on schema-collaboration, a system that uses Data Package Creator to enable data managers and researchers to create and share dataset schemas, edit them, post messages and export the schemas in different formats (text, Markdown, PDF). Before this tool was developed, researchers communicated with a data manager via email for each datapackage they were publishing, which slowed down considerably the whole process, besides making it more difficult.

To discover more about schema-collaboration, have a look at it on [GitHub](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/schema-collaboration/) or read [the blog](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/01/18/schema-collaboration/) Carles wrote about the project. If you would like to dive deeper and watch Carles’ presentation, you can find it here:

## Other agenda items from our hangout

- [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org/) is fast approaching! If you are organising something to celebrate open data on March 6<sup>th</sup>, let us know! You still have a few days to apply for mini-grants for your community events.

- [csv,conf,v6](https://csvconf.com/) is happening on May 4-5. If you want to give a talk, make sure to submit a proposal by February 28<sup>th</sup>. More info [here](https://csvconf.com/submit/).

## News from the community

Giuseppe Peronato and [cividi](https://cividi.ch/) started using Frictionless Data for data pipelines using (Geo-)Spatial datasets, e.g. raster data and GeoJSONs. You can have a look [here](https://github.com/datahq/dataflows/pull/153). They have also been looking more closely at the Creator’s UI library in a [prototype](https://github.com/gperonato/archive-forger) with researchers, and releasing a [QGIS plugin](https://blog.datalets.ch/073/) for Frictionless Data.

Thorben started working on the official vaccination publication by the German Federal Health Authority, which was replaced daily with a Data Package Pipeline saved as a Data Package by a GitHub Action. If you are interested, have a look [here](https://github.com/n0rdlicht/rki-vaccination-scraper).

## Join us next month!

Our next meeting will be on 25<sup>th</sup> February. Don’t miss the opportunity to get a code demonstration on frictionless.py by our very own Evgeny Karev (@roll).
