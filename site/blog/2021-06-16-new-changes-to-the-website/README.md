Have you noticed some changes to our website? Building upon last year’s [website redesign](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2020/05/01/announcing-new-website/), we have finished making some new changes that we are very excited to tell you about! When we started reviewing our documentation for the [Frictionless Python Framework](http://framework.frictionlessdata.io/) with the [support of the ODI](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/01/13/partnering-with-odi/#so-what-will-be-changing) back in January, we quickly realised that our main website could benefit from some revamping as well, in order to make it more user-friendly and easier to navigate.

We needed to clarify the relationship between our main project website and the website of all our Frictionless standards, software, and specifications, which all had different layouts and visual styles. The harmonisation process is still ongoing, but we are already very happy with the fact that the new website offers a comprehensive view of all our tools.

It was important for us that people visiting our website for the very first time could quickly understand what Frictionless Data is and how it can be useful to them. We did that through a reorganisation of the homepage and the navigation, which was a bit confusing for some users. We also updated most of the text to better reflect the current status of the project, but also to clearly state what Frictionless Data is. Users should now be able to understand in a glance that Frictionless is composed of two main parts, [software](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) and [standards](https://frictionlessdata.io/standards/), which make it more accessible for a broad range of people working with data.

Users will also easily find examples of [projects and collaborations that adopted Frictionless](https://staging.frictionlessdata.io/adoption/), which can be very useful to better understand the full potential of the Frictionless toolkit.

Our goal with this new website is to give visitors an easier way to learn about Frictionless Data, encourage them to try it out and join our great community. The new architecture should reflect that, and should make it easier for people to understand that Frictionless Data is a progressive open-source framework for building data infrastructure, aiming at making it easier to work with data. Being an open-source project, we welcome and cherish everybody’s contribution. Talking about that, we would love to hear your feedback! Let us know what you think about the new website, if you have any comments or if you see any further improvement we could make. We have created a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/website/issues/198) you can use to give us your thoughts. 

Thank you!
