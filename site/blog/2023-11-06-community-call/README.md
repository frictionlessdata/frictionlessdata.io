On our last community call on October 25<sup>th</sup>, we started discussing with the community the Frictionless specs update. Thanks to the generous support of [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/), the Frictionless core team, together with a working group composed of members of the community, will be focusing on this for the coming months.

## What is this update all about? 
Our main goal is really to make the current Frictionless specs a finished product. We have a list of GitHub issues that we will use as a starting point for this iteration, but we would like to follow decisions made by the working group. 

Please note, there will be no breaking changes (we can hear your sigh of relief!).

As a next step, **we will write a separate blog that will serve as a reference for the overarching goals and roadmap of the project.**

The core Frictionless team at Open Knowledge Foundation will also draft a governance model to apply to the review process and how things get merged. Ideally we would like to test and build a new governance model that would delegate more decisions to the community, and that would then stay in place beyond the v2 release, to improve the project sustainability.

Another key goal is to increase diversity to get better representation when we think about things. We have a couple of ideas in mind, but we welcome any suggestion you may have.
