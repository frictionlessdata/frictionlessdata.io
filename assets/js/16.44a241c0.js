It was two days of fantastic talks, llamas (of course!), and above all, vibrant community encounters. We met long term friends, community members, and made new meaningful connections. Our tech lead Evgeny Karev gave a talk on April 19th to present the beta version of the Frictionless Application, making it easier for non-coders to use all the Frictionless resources, helping them improve the quality of their data. Whether you’re a data scientist, researcher, or citizen analyst, the Frictionless Application empowers you to effortlessly describe, validate, extract, and transform data, all in one user-friendly environment.
