These in-house tools were extremely useful and flexible, but they were developed for an aging computing paradigm grounded in physical hardware accessing local data resources on disk.

This flexibility was appealing because it meant the intent of the data manager could be translated into many varying programming (and data) languages over time without having to refactor older workflows. In data management, that means that one of the languages a DPP workflow captures is provenance – a common need across oceanographic datasets for reproducibility. DPP Workflows translated into records of provenance explicitly communicates to data submitters and future data users what BCO-DMO had done during the curation phase.
