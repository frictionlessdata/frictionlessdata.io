I got an amazing boost in my digital skills altogether and I know exactly why (no I did not gain a few IQ points). I was in a helpful community and I matured in a way that enabled me to have more of a growth mindset. I also saw other people ‘fail’, as in having their code not working and having to google the solution! I have to say all the readings, the discussions, the tutorials, the Frictionless tools have been amazing, but this shift in my mindset has been the greatest gift the fellowship has given me.”")])])]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("Thank you Fellows!
