Since every iRODS repository can use different metadata keys for storing the information that the Data Packages require, the required key names are completely configurable by specifying the iRODS metadata keys to use in the mod_eirods_dav configuration file and you can do things like combining the values of multiple iRODS metadata keys with generic strings to produce the value that you want to use in the Data Package.
