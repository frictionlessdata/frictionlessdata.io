FDP lets a user define an order of processing steps to perform on some data, and the project developed new processing steps specific to the needs of these oceanographic datasets. These ordered processing steps are saved into a configuration file that is then available to be used anytime the archived version of the dataset must be reproduced. The primary value of these configuration files is that they capture and make the curation process at BCO-DMO transparent. Subsequently, we found additional value internally by using FDP in three other areas. First, they made the curation process across our data managers much more consistent versus the ad-hoc data processing scripts they individually produced before FDP. Second, we found that data managers saved time because they could reuse pre-existing pipelines to process newer versions submitted for pre-existing datasets. Finally, the configuration files helped us keep track of what processes were used in case a bug or error was ever found in the processing code.
