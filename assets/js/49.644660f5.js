This library extracts the community resource data, transforms that data into HSDS-compliant CSVs, and generates a datapackage.json that describes the data output. The Transformer can also output the datapackage as a zip file, called HSDS Zip, enabling systems to send and receive a single compressed file rather than multiple files. The Transformer can be spun up in a docker container — and once it’s live, the API can deliver a payload that includes links to the source data and to the configuration file that maps the source data to HSDS fields.
