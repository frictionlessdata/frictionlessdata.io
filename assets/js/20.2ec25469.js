A core mission of NeuroMat is the development of open-source computational tools to aid in scientific dissemination and advance open knowledge and open science. To this end, the team has created the Neuroscience Experiments System (NES), which is an open-source tool to assist neuroscience research laboratories in routine procedures for data collection. To more effectively understand the function and treatment of brain pathologies, NES aids in recording data and metadata from various experiments, including clinical data, electrophysiological data, and fundamental provenance information. NES then stores that data in a structured way, allowing researchers to seek and share data and metadata from those neuroscience experiments.
