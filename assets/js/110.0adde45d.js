Inclusion was the word that made it for me. At first I thought about how the Fellowship itself was inclusive for me, a person with a humanities background that had not had the chance to receive any institutional or structured support when it comes to programming and data management. Afterwards, what came to mind is how inclusive are the things I’m currently learning on the programme with regard with the populations I work in my clinical role. Cognitive accessibility is an effort to make online content more accessible to persons with overall cognitive difficulties, that is difficulties with memory, attention, and language. These are not rare difficulties, as they characterize individuals with learning difficulties (developmental language disorder, dyslexia), autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dementia, aphasia and other cognitive difficulties following a stroke. I discovered a lot of initiatives and guidelines on how online content could be more accessible: using alternatives to text, such as figures, audio, or a simpler layout, making content appear in predictable ways, giving more time to individuals to interact with the content, focusing on readability of the content among others. In sum, many individuals among us have difficulties accessing online content in an optimal way.

Research funding is nowadays so scarce and precarious in many countries that a simple article processing charge of 1200€ will prevent researchers from submitting to such journal. No doubt there is good will in those who fight to make the current publishing model more open.

Furthermore, as a journalist, I tend not to equate open access with accessibility more generally, because making something available or open doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be used (let alone understood by a wider audience!). This is the integral role that journalism can play within the open access academic community, in my view: through increased data literacy, visualisation tools, and what I call “translation through storytelling”. This is what drew me to #dataviz, and why I’m creating interactive visualisations of human rights data from the United Nations with OKF. While the Universal Periodic Review is well-known for being one of the most inclusive and equitable venues at the UN, few know about it outside of Geneva.

Not every potential reader of openly available science is fluent in English and Automatic translation is not always correct, but mere information translations can still convey the overall meaning. We can take help from open source development programs to empower organisations like CC Extractor and other local translation free softwares so we can include languages like Spanish, Italian, Hindi, Japanese and other native languages so that everyone is able to break those barriers and understand literature promoted in different languages. Similarly provide sustainable funding mechanisms and foster decentralized, community-owned/-run non-profit open source initiatives in this space.
