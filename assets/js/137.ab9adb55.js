The answer is complicated - sometimes that data is shared with other researchers, sometimes it is hidden away on a private hard drive. Sharing research data is a key part of open science, the movement to make research more accessible and usable by everyone to drive faster advances in science. A great way to share research data is to upload it to a repository, but simply uploading data is not the final step here. Ideally, the uploaded data will be of high quality - that is, it won’t have errors or missing data, and it will have enough descriptive information that other researchers can also use it! Over the last 6 months, we collaborated with the data repository Dryad to make it easier for researchers to upload their high quality data for sharing.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://datadryad.org/stash",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Dryad"),t("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" is a community-led data repository that allows researchers to submit data from any field, which not only promotes open science, but also helps researchers comply with open data policies from funders and journals.

We quickly realized our shared goals, and formed a Pilot collaboration to  add Frictionless validation functionality to the Dryad data upload page.
