It was 20th century still when I had a first contact with an Intel 80386 and installed Conectiva Linux Guarani 3.0. A lot has happened since, for instance, a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at UFCG after three years as a research assistant in the Distributed Systems Lab (LSD). It was already the 21st century when I realized that distributed and scalable systems were the way to go. I kept on studying the field and pursued a MSc at UFMG. From there I joined Google and spent 6 happy years working at multiple offices (NYC, ZRH, BHZ).  I’ve got the chance to work on a myriad of projects, ranging from social networks to Google’s default Java HTTP/RPC server framework.
