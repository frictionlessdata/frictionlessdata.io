# Publish Any Kind of Data

You can publish **all and any kind of data** as Data packages. It's as simple as 1-2-3:

1. Get your data together
2. Add a `datapackage.json` file to wrap those data files up into a useful
   whole (with key information like the license, title and format)
3. [optional] Share it with others, for example, by uploading the data package online

## 1. Get your data together

Get your data together in one folder (you can have data in subfolders of that
folder too if you wish).

## 2. Add a datapackage.json file

The `datapackage.json` is a small file in [JSON][] format that gives a bit of
information about your dataset. You'll need to create this file and then place
it in the directory you created.

<div class="alert">
Don't worry if you don't know what JSON is - we provide some tools that can
automatically create your this file for you.
</div>

There are 2 options for creating the `datapackage.json`:

Option 1: Use the online [datapackage.json creator tool][creator] - just answer
a few questions and give it your data files and it will spit out a
datapackage.json for you to include in your project

Option 2: Do it yourself - if you're familiar with JSON you can just create
this yourself. Take a look at the [Data Package][dp] tutorial.

## 3. Put the data package online
